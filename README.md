# 👋 "Hello, I'm on my journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer – and yes, I still debug with print statements 🐛"

🎓 I'm currently a 3rd-year Software Engineering student.  
💻 I break and build things using full-stack technologies.  
☕ I survive without coffee (yes, it's possible).  
🔧 My dream job? Full Stack Developer, or anything that makes me look smart in front of my computer.
